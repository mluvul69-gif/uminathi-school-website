            <p>
                uMinathi Christian School was established with the vision of
                providing quality Christian-based education to learners within
                the local community. The school was founded in response to the
                need for accessible secondary education for learners who were
                previously required to travel long distances to attend school.
            </p>

            <p>
                In its early years, uMinathi Christian School operated from
                rented facilities while laying the foundation for future growth.
                Through the support of community leaders, donors, and
                philanthropic organisations, the school was later able to move
                into its own purpose-built premises.
            </p>

            <p>
                The development of the school was made possible through
                partnerships with charitable foundations and the generosity of
                the local traditional authority, who donated land to support the
                project. The completed facilities provided classrooms designed
                to create a safe and supportive learning environment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beginning with lower secondary grades, the school gradually
                expanded its academic offerings as learner enrolment increased.
                uMinathi Christian School continues to grow with a commitment to
                academic excellence, discipline, moral values, and service to
                the community.
